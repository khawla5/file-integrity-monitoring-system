# 🔐 File Integrity Monitoring System (FIM)

A File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system developed using **Python**, **Flask**, and **React** to monitor critical files, detect unauthorized modifications, and display file integrity status through a real-time dashboard.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is an essential cybersecurity technique used to verify that important files have not been modified, deleted, or tampered with without authorization.

This project monitors selected files by generating a **SHA-256 hash** for each file and comparing it with the previously stored hash value. Any modification is detected and displayed through a web dashboard.

The system was implemented and tested using sample data to simulate real-world file monitoring scenarios.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Monitor important files.
- 🔐 Generate SHA-256 hashes.
- 🚨 Detect file modifications.
- 📁 Detect newly added files.
- 📊 Interactive dashboard using React.
- 🔄 Automatic refresh every 5 seconds.
- 🌐 REST API using Flask.
- 💾 Store file information using SQLite and SQLAlchemy.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Select files to monitor.
2. Generate SHA-256 hashes.
3. Save hashes in the database.
4. Continuously monitor files.
5. Detect file changes.
6. Update the dashboard automatically.
7. Notify the user when modifications occur.
